Add custom agreement checkboxes to the registration form of your WooCommerce shop. The plugin also features a double password validation.

== Description ==
This plugin allows you to add custom agreement selectable checkboxes to the Registration Form of your online store. You can define which checkboxes are mandatory to be checked/selected in order to register a new account. The plugin features also a double password validation, which adds an extra field that prompts an User to repeat his/her password.

Already registered users can see the form right underneath their "account details" and the plugin forces them to check the mandatory checkboxes as well upon saving their details.

! IMPORTANT: in order to use this plugin, you must enable "Allow customers to create an account on the "My account" page"
in WooCommerce > Settings > Accounts & Privacy
